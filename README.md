# Code Refactor

## Description

For this project, I created a professional portfolio page. The criterias that it must meet include:

- Have my name, a recent photo, and a nav bar link to sections of the portfolio
- Sections must include a About Me, Work, and Contact Me
- Work section must have deployed projects to showcase with link to URL
- Top project must be displayed larger than the rest
- Portfolio must have responsive layout that can adapt to viewport

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to build a professional portfolio to showcase my skills. This will be sent to employers looking to fill positions. The portfolio must be able to allow potential employers to easily read a little bit about me, see my deployed projects, and contact me if necessary.

## Result

The below picture is the final result. This will continue to be a work in progress as I develop and learn new skills and deploy more complex projects.
